Textron Systems has introduced its “Tsunami” family of autonomous surface vessels designed for unmanned maritime missions of the US military and allies.
A Tsunami drone can operate up to Sea State 4 or environments with waves from 4.1 to 8.2 feet (1.25 to 2.5 meters) and over a range of more than 1,000 nautical miles (1,852 kilometers/1,151 miles).
The boat has a payload capacity of 1,000 pounds (454 kilograms) and is offered in 24, 25, and 28-foot (7.3, 7.6, and 8.5-meter) hull variants.

Textron developed the “low-cost, rapidly deployable” drone by combining the Maryland-based firm’s more than four decades of multi-domain autonomous vehicle experience with US commercial shipbuilding capabilities.
It incorporates Textron’s proprietary Common Unmanned Surface Vehicle autonomy suite and is powered by gasoline to match the mission, sustainability, and cost-effectiveness requirements of future users.
Meanwhile, the Tsunami’s hull was based on a vessel offered by boat manufacturer Brunswick Corporation.
“Textron Systems understands how to design, integrate, field and support autonomous systems across the air, land and sea domains, because we are unique in having done that,” Textron Air, Land, and Sea Systems SVP David Phillips stated.
“Combining this expertise with the capability, demonstrated capacity, and affordability of Brunswick’s commercial shipbuilding know-how allows us to provide our [Department of Defense] and allied customers with powerful maritime force strength at speed and at scale.”
